##**Contain All The External Pipe Files**
_These pipes are imported across the application_

These pipe files mostly are shared across the feature modules.

---
Depending on preference only, any structure is acceptable. However, its structure should be module and follow the feature subjects above for better management.
- UnixDate pipe (`unix-date.pipe.ts`)
---

Should not put service/pipes/component/etc. to this shared folder.
